This bot is designed for usage on theinfosphere.org, if you desire to
use it for another wiki project, please ensure to create the following
file in the main directory:

Name: logindata.py

Structure:
class userdata:
	username = "Username"
	password = "Password"

This file is not included in this repository for obvious reasons.

Moreover, several parts of the tasks, etc. make specific references to
'SvipBot' as the username of the bot.  In the future, I hope to make
a more principle outlook, by using the Username supplied in logindata.py
